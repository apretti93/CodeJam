    /*
         * The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T.
         *  T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing
    five integers: X (the length of the corridor, in meters),
     S (your walking speed, in meters per second), 
     R (your running speed, in meters per second),
      t (the maximum time you can run, in seconds) and N (the number of walkways).

    Each of the next N lines contains three integers: 
    Bi, Ei and wi - the beginning and end of the walkway
     (in meters from your starting point) and the speed of the walkway (in meters per second).
