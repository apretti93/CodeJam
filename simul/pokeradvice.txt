5 handed at least 20% equity

A2-A5

19% winning; 
48% with a top pair
25% with a bottom pair

assuming top pair :

if 3rd card hits, about 4*# of players chance
someone hit their flush ; very common semi bluff

another 15% chance someone hit trips, 2 pair, or
a straight ; 2 pair is most likely

85% -- turn 
75% -- river

board pairing ; about 42% winning with 2 pair
27% losing to trips, 27% it paired someone else's trips
