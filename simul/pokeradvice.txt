Reraise is generally a sign of strength for beginners

2 pair is not the nuts, only go all in against a real established fish
particularly after I've established strength.  no real point in re-reaising

Never decide you have won, watch out, particularly after flopping something like 2 pair

** I tend to get way too agressive when I think I have the best hand, this helped me lose
"only" around 300k vs a set when I had 2 pair.

** I tend to call too easily w/ shortstacked players.

Folded top pair to shortstack all in



** I tend to get trapped by slow players.

** Bewary of deep stacks!  

** It seems I can value bet the river more in later position after no river bets,
have yet to be check raised, too much fear of that.

mistakes
In 3 way hand with TPTK, bet 2/3 pot max pot, not all in!


Early position flop/turn/river pot sized bet into my 2 pair 54 board J54
50k 200k 400k is indicative of a pretty good hand, better than a pair.

Could have reraised early to get an idea of strength of his hand
