** Reraise is generally a sign of strength for beginners

** 2 pair is not the nuts, only go all in against a real established fish
particularly after I've established strength.  no real point in re-reaising

** Never decide you have won, watch out, particularly after flopping something like 2 pair or TPTK

** I tend to call too easily w/ shortstacked players.

>> Folded top pair to shortstack all in

** I tend to get trapped by slow players in full ring

** Bewary of deep stacks!  

** It seems I can value bet the river more in later position after no river bets,
have yet to be check raised, too much fear of that.  An exception is in 5 hand, check raises
more common

** In 3 way hand with TPTK, bet 1/3 to 2/3 pot max pot, not all in!

Early position flop/turn/river pot sized bet into my 2 pair 54 board J54
50k 200k 400k is indicative of a pretty good hand, better than a pair.

Could have reraised early to get an idea of strength of his hand

** on a tight table, I reraised 240k; flopped A69.  Someone in early position bet 400k, who bets 40k
with top pair.  I reraised they called.  Turn was an ace, they were going all in.  

The general mistake is that against tightish players, I'm losing my whole stack.  Another example, I had
K7 villian KT, flop was KK*  then turn was a T, and player was going nuts.

So when I show aggression and am not hiding my hand, unless player is a maniac, just fold!


** Trying to bluff into a unknown element
** Deciding to bluff w/o really looking at flop texture

Early position continuel pot or near size pot size bets generally means 2 pair or better.  If I have the lowest 2 pair, I should consider folding.  

I can beat overpair, top pair but not better 2 pair or set


**Someone calling a short stack all in may still have a premium pocket pair,
do not rereaise with AQ or some crap like that willy nilly


** Someone doing some crazy preflop raise like 1 million, think twice about calling
with QQ, even against a beginner.  Wait until you see their range is loose.


** AK vs 3 others.  If I hit top pair, most likely beat by hidden trips, watch for reraises!

AK vs 2.  If I do not hit the flop, about 1/3 I am winning w/ high card.

Early position, should check (unless I want to cbet)
Late position, bet if both check (they probably would have bet their pairs)

drawing hands need 4 to 5 callers (30% of hitting something, 25-20% bet)


**  Still have a problem calling all in with just top pair, it's  a sucker play to call
