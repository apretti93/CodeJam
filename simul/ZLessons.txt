Early position continuel pot or near size pot size bets generally means 2 pair or better.  If I have the lowest 2 pair, I should consider folding.  

I can beat overpair, top pair but not better 2 pair or set


**Someone calling a short stack all in may still have a premium pocket pair,
do not rereaise with AQ or some crap like that willy nilly


** Someone doing some crazy preflop raise like 1 million, think twice about calling
with QQ, even against a beginner.  Wait until you see their range is loose.


** AK vs 3 others.  If I hit top pair, most likely beat by hidden trips, watch for reraises!

AK vs 2.  If I do not hit the flop, about 1/3 I am winning w/ high card.

Early position, should check (unless I want to cbet)
Late position, bet if both check (they probably would have bet their pairs)

drawing hands need 4 to 5 callers (30% of hitting something, 25-20% bet)
