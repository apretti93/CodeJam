Early position continuel pot or near size pot size bets generally means 2 pair or better.  If I have the lowest 2 pair, I should consider folding.  

I can beat overpair, top pair but not better 2 pair or set


**Someone calling a short stack all in may still have a premium pocket pair,
do not rereaise with AQ or some crap like that willy nilly


** Someone doing some crazy preflop raise like 1 million, think twice about calling
with QQ, even against a beginner.  Wait until you see their range is loose.
